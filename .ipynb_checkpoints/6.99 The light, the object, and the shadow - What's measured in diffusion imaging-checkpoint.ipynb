    "**Extending the logic of a data structure** \n",
    "\n",
    "_Stretching a data object across another dimension_\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, when we discussed the data structure of a T1 we noted that it was a 3 dimensional data structure representing a 3 dimensional object.  Likewise we noted that jpeg imgaes were a 2 (ish, in the case of color) dimensional data represenetation.  In a manner of speaking, the 3-dimensional data structure is just an extension of the same data representation practice as the 2D image.  In short, we can extend the general framework of our data structure to create a new and augmented data structure which captures a more complex aspect of the object/phenomena being measuered.  In the case of 2D images we can extend them across the temporal dimension to create a movie (think of this as a stack of 2 dimenional data objects stacked along a third dimension).  In doing so we are able to see the scene (or more technically, light reflected by the objects in the scene) chagne with time.  In the case of MRI data, we could also extend this data object across the temporal dimension to obtain something like a 3 dimensional movie, which is, to some extent, the idea behind fMRI.  There's a pretty important caviot to this, similar to the previous sentence's caviot indicating that it's _actualy_ the scene's reflectance properties that we're seeing, but we'll come back to that later.  For now though, its enough to know that we can extend those data types we are familiar with (i.e. images/JPEGs and MRI Volumes/NIFTIs.  But this isn't the only manner in which we can extend them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rather than taking a sequence of images across time, what if we simply rotated the object in place?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets consider this possibility in the case of 2D images and, for the sake of consistency with our previous examples, lets use the world as an example.  In this (imagined) case, we'll pretend that we've placed a sattilite in orbit around the equator _but_ it's \"stationary\" such that Earth appears to be rotating at such a speed that it completes a full rotation every 24 hours.  In a sense, this is basically the same effect as rotating a stationary object in front of a camera.  As the world rotates, we take an image every so often until one full rotation has been made.  In this way, we have compiled a sequence of images that depict the same object from a number of angles and, in doing so, we are able to make some decent inferences about the structure of the 3D object from the compilation of 2D images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets go ahead and explore this notion by looking at the images from a gif depicting a rotating earth.  Run the next block of code, which contains some code needed to explore a gif, and then use the interactive slider in the subsequent block to rotate around the Earth and get a sense of how a sequence of 2D images can give you information about the structure of a 3D object."
