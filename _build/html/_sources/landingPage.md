# White Matter Segmentation Education (WiMSE)

A practical, hands on guide to the logic and practice of digital white matter segmentation

## What is this?

This resource is a collection of [jupyer notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks designed to build intuitions for and provide training in digital white matter segmentation.  The modern-day practice of digital white matter segmentation is as much about programming as it is about neuroanatomy, which is why the medium of [jupyer notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) has been chosen.  In this way, users are able to view commented code alongside text explaining the context, goals, and implications of what is being done.  *However, there's a catch to this!*  Because interactivity is key to many of these lessons, **you will often need to click the rocket-ship symbol at the top of the page to open a [binder](https://mybinder.org/)**.  This will allow you to actually **run and interact with code in your browser!**, which, in turn, will give you a better understanding of *how* the code is operating.

## How is it structured?

On the left hand side of this page there is a navigation bar listing several chapters and their sub-sections.  The first of these is the "Front matter" which concerns many of the formalities associated with this lesson collection.  Among its sections is the **chapter summaries** there you'll find brief

## TEMPORARY NOTICE:  UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Currently (9/25/2020), this resource is under construction and so some lessons may be incomplete or may not be completely functional.  Work is ongoing and a roughly complete version of this is expected by mid December 2020.
