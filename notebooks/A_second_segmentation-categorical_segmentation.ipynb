    "# A second segmentation - categorical segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we introduced the fundamental operation of digital white matter segmentation:  the application of an inclusion (or exclusion) ROI.  Indeed, at their heart, all segmentations are composed of some finite number of applications of these operations.  We began with the hopefully intuitive case of a planar ROI, which was used to (in essence) assess the traversal of streamlines across a certian coordinate threshold.  After also demonsrating applications of _modified_ planar ROIs (i.e. partial planar ROIs), we then demonstrated the use of ROI intersecton using a sphere.  These are both quite common uses of ROIs for white matter segmentation, however they are by no means _exhaustive_ of the tools available to segmenters.  Indeed, in keeping with the recurrent theme of repurposing existing tools and resources, one of our most powerful abilities turns out to be using anatomical parcellations (from structural data, e.g. [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) to perform white matter segmentation.  In fact, our fist consideration of a \"complete segmentation\" (see chapter \"Segmenting Tracts-Conceptualy\" for a definition of this term), was technically an \"anatomically based segmentation\" in that the parcellation we used to generate the connectome/segmentation was composed of anatomical labels.  Lets consider the conceptual underpinnings of anatomical segmentations a bit more before we perform our second segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using grey matter parcellations with white matter tractograms\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that we should note about anatomically-based segmentations from the outset centers on the notion of **biological plausibility**, which was discussed broadly in a previous chapter.  Specifically, we should think back to what most existing anatomical parcellations are:  grey matter segmentations.  This means that the areas that are being labeled are typically where neuronal cell bodies (and not mid to long-range mylenated axons) are located.  As such, if we take our tractome at face value, and assume that it is a _valid, accurate, and biologicall plausible_ model of white matter anatomy and trajectory, we won't typically find streamlines traversing these labeled volumes unless they also terminate there.  Streamlines are therefore expected to course through anatomical volumes corresponding to white matter before they ultimately land in an area corresponding to a grey matter label.  Recent tractography generation methods, like [mrtrix 3's \"Anatomically-Constrained Tractography (ACT)\"](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quantitative_structural_connectivity/act.html), build this into their tractography generation models, in order to generate higher quality tractomes in the first place.  Previously (i.e. mrtrix 2) and/or with other tractography generation algorithms, this criteria was not implemented, and so streamlines could terminate in or traverse through biologically implausible areas.  Thus, the assesment of streamline termination areas can provide useful information about the anatomical characeristics of streamlines and the white matter components they putatively model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The possibility of using streamline termination areas to label streamlines should seem familiar to you--this was the method we used in the \"A first segmentation\" chapter.   There, we used a [dipy connectome generation method](https://dipy.org/documentation/1.0.0./examples_built/streamline_tools/) which is algorithmically predicated upon the labeling (or, alternatively, segmenting/categorizing) of streamlines based upon their terminal nodes.  In fact, the failure to generate a connectome using terminations, and to instead consider instances of traversal as an edge measure, could theoretically result in more connections than your tractome has streamlines (and can thus also serve as a good sanity check) as well as potentially implausible connectivity profiles.  Explicitly put:  a streamline's traversal arbitrarily close to a particular label (which may or may not, itself, occupy a biologically implausible volume of the relevant atlas) _is not_ sufficient evidence for connectivity.  More generally though, its worth noting that connectome generation methods are, generally speaking, _necessarily_ agnostic to the atlases/parcellations that they are applied to.  In order to be maximally useful to network investigators, their algorithms typically reflect a minimal number of assumptions such that they simply iterate over labels and note which streamlines terminate \"in\" (i.e. \"sufficiently near\") which areas.  This is not at all an inherently bad feature of connectome generation methods, but rather this is to point out that the resulting categories / connective structures may not always correspond to intuitive or interpretable types.  However, if we leverage our anatomical knowledge _before_ applying a parcellation-agnostic white matter segmentation of this sort, we can generate a segmentation that:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  1.  Results in intuitve streamline categories\n",
    "-  2.  Is, in essence, generalizable beyond the specific input grey matter parcellation used to generate it (in that any number of grey matter parcellations could be used to produce this segmentation)\n",
    "-  3.  Proves to be _immensely_ useful when segmenting more specific white matter anatomy structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we acheive this?  By performing a gross anatomical category segmentation of the white matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A gross-anatomy categorical segmentation of white matter\n",
    "\n",
    "The term gross anatomy corresponds to the study of anatomical features which are macroscopically evident.  In the case of performing a categorical, gross anatomical segmentation of white matter this means dividing up the white matter in accordance with its connectivity with gross anatomical brain structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, parcellations and atlases of the cortex (and subcortex) divide regions up into established and well studied areas (e.g. [Brodmann's areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brodmann_area).  However, we needn't rely in such fine grained parcellations of the brain in order to begin the process of dividing up white matter structures into useful subcomponents.  Instead, we can simply consider more general structures like the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, along with other higher order structure groupings (e.g. the thalamus, midbrain, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets begin the process of implementing this segmentation by assigning the regions of the [\"Destrieux\" 2009 atlas](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.neuroimage.2010.06.010) to these gross anatomical categories.  Luckily, this work has been done previously for a [brainlife app](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.249) / [wma_tools product](https://github.com/DanNBullock/wma_tools/blob/master/Segmentations/bsc_streamlineCategoryPriors_v7.m).  First we'll (exhaustively, in that we'll do it for all labels) establish the meaningful label categories we are interested in.  Then we will relabel the atlas in accordance with these groupings, in much the same way we renumbered atlas labels in the chapter \"How to interpret a volumetric brain segmentation\"."

    "## What's a categorical segmentation good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have generated a gross-anatomy categorical segmentation you may find yourself asking \"Why did we do this?\" or \"What can this be used for?\".  As it turns out there are a number of potential applications for a gross-anatomy categorical segmentation like this.  We'll start with some of the more general uses first\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological plausibility check\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking back to our earlier conceptual discussion of segmentations, this constitutes a \"complete\" segmentation.  This is because each streamline is **necessarily** assigned a category.  As such this allows us to obtain a broad overview of the characteristics of the input tractome and the streamlines that constitute it.  For example, if one were concerned with the general biological plausiblity of their tractome, this segmentation (and visualization) can be used to look at streamlines that terminate in biologically implausible areas (i.e. ventricles, white matter, and \"unknown\").  As such, the larger the proportion of streamlines that fall into these categories, the more one should be concerned about the quality of the tractography.  The relative number of streamlines in particular categories can also be useful for assessing the input tractome in other ways as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate viability check\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps one of the key insights that this guide endeavors to impart upon users is that even the best segmentation algorithm can't find what isn't there.  If the input tractome doesn't contain amongst its many candidate features (e.g. streamlines) some semblance of the structure of interest, then no amount of clever criteria application will be able to extract it.  But what's a quick way to check if the source of your problem is the tractome or the segmentation?  By looking at a categorical segmentation and the general category that the structure would be associated with, its possible to get a good sense of whether the isn't even there to be segmented, or if your specific segmentation implementation is missing it.  As an example of how to perform this check, consider the case in which either you or a downstream segmentation consumer notices that the inferior fronto-occipital fasiculus (IFOF) derived from a segmentation looks particularly weak or anemic.  To determine whether the issue is the tractography or the segmentation, all one needs to do is look at the \"occipital to frontal\" (or vice versa) category and see whether there are long range streamlines running along the inferiror of the tractome.  If they are there, but not in the segmented IFOF, this suggests that the segmentation is at fault.  If they are not visible in the general category, or if there are very few of them, this suggests that the tractography is at fault.  Below you will find a non-exhaustive table of some major white matter structures and the categories they are associated with:\n",

    "\n",
    "In cases where you are attempting to segment a relatively large tractome (i.e. more than 250,000 streamlines) and your segmentation tools include the relevant algorithmic speed-ups (as is the case with wma_tools), the earlier in the sementation algorithm for a given structure that you drastically reduce the number of streamlines you are considering, the faster your segmentation will process.  This is due to the number of distance computations that need to be performed by ROI criteria applications (as discussed in previous ROI chapters).  As such, applying a category criteria is a relatively generous (in that it doesn't really impose that stringent of a criteria) and efficient method for reducing the number of streamlines you are considering.  Although specifying termination regions up front may seem objectionable to some, its worth noting that (1) we aren't imposing particularly specific requirements of the streamlines given how general the gross anatomical areas are (2) in keeping with the table above (and the fact that we have to take streamlines _at face value_) estabished tracts are _definitionally required_ to terminate in certian regions.\n",
