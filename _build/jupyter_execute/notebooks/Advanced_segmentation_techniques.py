# # Advanced segmentation techniques
# 
# In the previous chapter we introduced the fundamental operation of digital white matter segmentation:  the application of an inclusion (or exclusion) ROI.  We began with the intuitive case of a planar ROI, which was used to assess the traversal of streamlines across a certian coordinate threshold.  We then demonstrated another example of ROI intersecton using a sphere.  These are both quite common applications of regions of interest to white matter segmentation, however they are by no means _exhaustive_ of our tools for segmenting.  Indeed, in keeping with the recurrent insight that being able to releverage established tools can be of *immense* utility, one of our most powerful tools is being able to use anatomical parcellations (from structural data, e.g. [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).  As we shall see, this is quite similar to how we used state color data to mask the digital image of the United States, or parcellation data to mask

# ## The first step: using anatomical ROIs

# 
# ## Using parcellation ROIs to establish anatomically defined planar ROIS
# 
# ## Modifying parcellation ROIs using planar ROIs (i.e. cutting)
# 
# ## Modifying anatomically defined planar ROIs using other anatomically defined planar ROIs
# 
# ## Inflating parcellation regions of interest
