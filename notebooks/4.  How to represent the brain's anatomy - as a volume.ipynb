    "For now, we'll only briefly consider a few of these features, but we'll to each of these as we necessary as we proceed through the next set of lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**dim**](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/documentation/nifti1fields/nifti1fields_pages/dim.html/document_view):  This field displays the dimensions of the NIfTI image data object.  The first number (3, in this case) indicates the total number of dimensions occupied by the data.  The next several values (as many as indicated by the first number in this vector) correspond to the span of each of those dimensions.  Thus, in this case the first dimension spans 145 entries, the second spans 174 entires, and the third spans 145 entries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[**datatype**](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/documentation/nifti1fields/nifti1fields_pages/datatype.html):  This field corresponds to the [*type* of numerical data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format)  contained within each of the nifti image data object's entries.  Here we see that it is \"float32\".  This gives us two primary peices of information: (1) we now know that the numerical entries are *not* integers or whole numbers (and thus they can adopt values *between* 1,2,3, etc.)  and (2) we now know that each of these entries [takes up about 4 bytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format).  \n",
    "\n",
    "[**pixdim**](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/documentation/nifti1fields/nifti1fields_pages/pixdim.html/document_view):  Ignoring the initial (-1) and last four values in this field (1. 0. 0. 0.), we see the numbers 1.25 1.25 1.25.   These indicate the size of the real world entities that correspond to the nifti image data object's entries.  In the case of the map from the previous chapter, this would have corresponded roughly to hundreds of square miles (though the exact quantity would be complex issue given that the pixels dont correspond the same surface area size).  In this case, we see that each of these values is 1.25 millimeters, which means that the data in any entry of the NIfTI represents a 1.25 by 1.25 by 1.25 = 1.953125 cubic millimeter volume of space.  The fifth value (1) isn't particularly relevant to this particular nifti, as our nifti data object is only 3 dimensional.  If we were examining fMRI data, this value would indicate the timestep used for the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, its important to note that all three of the spatial dimension measures examined above are the same.  This need not be the case, and it could be that our voxels are actually representing units of space whose sides are not all equal.  In this case though, we can say that the voxels are \"isometric\", meaning that all faces are the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[**qform_code**](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/documentation/nifti1fields/nifti1fields_pages/qsform.html):  This field specifies the orientation schema that will be detailed in subsequent fields.  In the previous lesson we considered the intersection of the [prime maridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IERS_Reference_Meridian) and [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator) as the \"origin\" of the major orientation schema we used, and endeavored to overlay these locations when we aligned global satellite images.  But imagine that we instead used some other coordinate system to establish a different origin point.  Alternatively, what if we stopped using degrees as our unit of measure or that we flipped our labeling convention for east and west? In any of these cases, we would need to find a way to indicate what our refrence frame was.  This need for specification of orientation system is reflected in the **qform_code** of the NIfTI header.  Here, we have some indicator (\"mni\" or \"talarach\", for example) that establish a common refrence frame for orienting the image data.  \"mni\" and \"talarach\" respectively correspond to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute [citation] and Talairach [citation] atlases.  These and other neuroimaging reference frames are well described [elsewhere](http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/faq/how_are_the_different_head_and_mri_coordinate_systems_defined/).\n",

    "[**qoffset_x, qoffset_y , qoffset_z**](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/documentation/nifti1fields/nifti1fields_pages/qsform.html) (see \"METHOD 2\"):  These numbers are the transforms necessary to align this image to the reference specified in \"qform_code\".  Referring back to our previous lessons, you can think of these numbers as the shift needed to align the political map with the geographic map. Now though, we have three dimensions (as opposed to two) and need to align each of them.  Typically our goals when aligning MRI images  are threefold:  (1) that the images share matching scales, (2) that the images exhibit the same orientation (e.g. top -> top, left -> left, etc.), and (3) that the images points share the same \"origin\".         \n",
    "\n",
    "We have now looked at some important features of the [NIfTI header](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/src/niftilib/nifti1.h).  However, we haven't yet taken a look the actual data component of a NIfTI, as we did with digital images in previous lessons.  Lets move forward at take a look at this now."

What about all of the others though?  How can we get a comprehensive and informative sense of those?  Lets take a hint from our digital image lessons and explore this NIfTI data by plotting a histogram of the data values for each voxel.  In a certian sense, we're lucky (relative to the digital image case) because we can plot a sensible histogram for this information, as there aren't 3 distinct color channels to worry about (which would make it difficult to interpret a histogram or set of histograms).  Additionally, we can get a sense of what how many total voxels there are, how many are \"non-zero\" (in that they contain a measure distinct from zero), and what proportion of the total number of voxels this corresponds to. Lets do that now."

    "It seems that about a quarter of the voxels contain data that we would consider to be reprsentatve of the brain, with the assumption that \"empty\" voxels correspond to background and/or uninformative voxels.  Depending on whether or not this T1 has had the brain \"extracted\" (i.e. the brain isolated from the rest of the head, neck, and body, via a masking process), this proporation may also include non-brain tissues.  Indeed, given that we took a look at this very same T1 image in the previous lesson, we know that this is the case an that the brian has been isolated from non brain tissues.  Furthermore, note how we had to split the histogram in two.  Had we not done this, the number of empty voxels would have overwhelmed the visualization and we wouldn't have been able to observe the distribution visible in the plot on the right due to the extreme number of values right below 0.\n",

Take note that the left, posterior, inferior corner is the 0 coordinate.  The coordinate shift that results in the posterior commisure being at (0,0,0) occurs after the previously qoffset information has been applied.  After this transform has been applied, locations in the left hemisphere are characterized by coorinates that have a negative first value (x coordinate).\n",

    "If you move the slider coordinates to the value specified under \"Coordinates of posterior commisure\", your crosshair should directly target the posterior commisure.  Note though, that the coordinates specified are actually real numbers, rather than interger values.  This is interesting because the indexes of the sliders correspond to data structure indexes of the currently visualized \"slices\"--which can't actually take on non-integer values.  We can't actually navigate to the 100.8 Y or 57.6 Z slices.  This illustrates how the header information, by selecting an *exact* coordinate to represent the posterior commisure, can specify a location with precision that exceeds the actual information contained within the data.  Lets consider in a bit more detail the actual transform we had to apply to make this calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Admittedly, the notion of a shift or transform gets a bit more complicated in three dimensions, where it is possible to have your data rotated or flipped along multiple dimensions.  With a standard 2d image this would have been quite obvious upon inspection--you would notice if the world had been rotated 90% or flipped such that Russia was west of the US's \"east\" coast!  Although some of these changes are obvious in a NIfTI image (for example a 90 degree rotation), some are less obvious.  For example, as it turns out, **this brain data is flipped in its x axis!**. Because of this the right hemisphere data is stored in indexes smaller than the X coordinate of the posterior commissure (72) while the left hemisphere data is stored in indexes that are larger than the X coordinate of the posterior commissure.  This is contrary to standard orientation schemas.  Lets take a look at how we could come to know this by taking a look at the [affine transform matrix].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) again."

    "You'll notice that the upper left hand value (-1.25), which specifies the voxel resolution of the Y dimension, is negative.  This is as opposed to the values found for the Y and Z dimension resolutions, which are postitive.  Considered in conjunction with the information in the first three rows for the rightmost column (the **qoffset_** information from the header), this indicates that a flip in the X dimension is present.
