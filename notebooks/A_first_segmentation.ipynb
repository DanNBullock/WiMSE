    "# A first segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we examined a single streamline.  In this chapter we will perform a \"segmentation\" of sorts, wherein we divide up the whole brain tractogram.  One of the challenges we experienced in the previous chapter was that the whole brain tractogram is unweildy and impenetrable.  What we need is the ability to look at specific sub-components of the tractogram in order to systematically make insights about our model of the brain's white matter.  But how would we do this?  We can find the answer to this by reflecting on our earlier work with satellite images. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a tractogram tractable\n",
    "\n",
    "**How could we systematically divide up the white matter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we seek to make our tractogram more managable we find ourselves in a position similar to the one we were in when considering the satellite images.  Although we have an intuitive understanding with the familiar geography depicted in the satellite image, we nonetheless needed to narrow our consideration of the available data in order to make good use of it.  In the satellite case we performed an ocean-based mask, and in the NiFTI case we used an existing parcellation.  But how would we do this with a whole brain tractogram?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps we can leverage the analogy we used earlier when we refered to the white matter as the \"highways of the brain\".  If we consider the various regions of the brain (e.g. the ones we find in a parcellation) to be like the states of the United States, and the white matter to be the roads that connect them an approach presents itself.  Perhaps we could do a pairwise matching between all the places that the highways (or streamlines) start and finish.  After all, both white matter tracts and roads have to begin and end somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "To to acheive our goal of tractogram sub-selection we can leverage the parcellation data we were looking at previously.  This data object assigns each voxel a label, and so we can--for each streamline--determine which labels its endpoints are closest to.  This will give us a mapping of streamlines which have ends in both regions A and B, A and C, C and B, and so on and so forth for all possible pairings of labels.\n",

    "Now that we have performed that lengthy segmentation, lets take a quantative look at how many streamlines are connecting each region.  We'll first do this using the standard method of of [connectomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectomics), a connectivity matrix.  In brain connectivity matrix plot, each row/column corresponds to a brain area in a given parcellation.  Each entry (i.e. row X, column Y) is represented by a scaled color and corresponds to the measure of connectivity between those brain areas.  In the matrix we will plot below, that color value will correspond to the number of streamlines connecting those areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a warning, these plots are somewhat difficult to comprehend in that it is difficult to associate particular areas with a trend or insight.  Typically these plots are used to depict and infer genreal patterns in the overall connectivity arrangment of the brain.  "
